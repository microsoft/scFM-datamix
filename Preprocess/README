This folder contains three scripts:

- preprocess_data_bloodbase.py generates training datasets for the Blood Baseline set of experiments visualized in Figure 2 and Figure S2. It takes as input a random seed that is used for subsetting datasets. 
- preprocess_data_allbase.py generates training datasets for the Atlas Baseline set of experiments visualized in Figure S4 and Figure S6. It takes as input a random seed that is used for subsetting datasets. 
- preprocess_eval_data.py generates evaluation datasets.


These scripts require download of several publicly available datasets:

- For the Blood or Atlas (baseline) models, the relevant scTab datasets can be downloaded using the instructions at https://github.com/microsoft/scFM-dataselection/tree/main/data/preprocess, using the instructions under the README heading "Download and concatenate scTab". For these datasets, we downloaded 10% of the scTab dataset. Distinct subsets were used for training and evaluation.
- For the Curated Cancer Cell Atlas, hematopoietic malignancy data can be downloaded at https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/hematologic. Studies to be retained can be found in the methods section of the main manuscript. The script we used to generate the file "cca_Hematologic_aggregated.h5ad" from the downloaded files is "data_wrangling_scripts/cca_wrangle.ipynb". The Ji et al SCC evaluation dataset can be downloaded from https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/skin. 
- For the Perturb-Seq datasets, raw sequencing data in the form of MEX files can be downloaded at GEO accession GSE264667 for the Jurkat experiment, and at https://gwps.wi.mit.edu/ for the K562 data. The script we used to generate the files K562_essential_raw_singlecell_01_mex_collated.h5ad and GSE264667_jurkat_raw_singlecell_01_mex_collated.h5ad is "data_wrangling_scripts/collate_weissman_MEX.ipynb".
-For the Bone Marrow dataset, similar instructions to the above scTab instructions should be used. Because of the relatively small number of bone marrow cells in scTab, we downloaded 100% of the scTab dataset prior to subsetting to bone marrow. Distinct subsets were used for training and evaluation.
- For the TF Atlas dataset, the file GSE217460_210322_TFAtlas_subsample_raw.h5ad can be downloaded directly from GEO accession GSE217460. Preprocessing this dataset also makes use of the publicly available GTeX file GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_median_tpm.gct, which can be found at https://www.gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression
- The Human Brain Cell Atlas neuron dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain. The script we used to generate the file "Neurons_H18.30.002_10Ksubset.h5ad" is "data_wrangling_scripts/explore_subset_SilettiNeuron.ipynb".
