This folder contains a script, `Train_Models.py`, that trains Blood- and Atlas-baseline LDVAE models using the scvi-tools package. It takes a random seed as input, and it outputs trained models as well as training curves.

For details on the training parameters and model architecture, please see the Methods section of the manuscript.
