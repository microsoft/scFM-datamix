This folder contains a script, Train_Models.py, that trains Blood- and Atlas-baseline LDVAE models using the scvi-tools package. It takes as input a random seed. It outputs trained models as well as training curves.

For details on the training parameters and model architecture, please see the Methods section of the manuscript.
